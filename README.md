# TutorialPlatformer2D  
Code and Assets for a Simple Platformer Demo in Unity for a Tutorial  

This requires a project to be created with the 2D game template.  

Project is now available as Unity Package file, upgraded for Unity 2021.3, available in releases: https://github.com/Wally869/TutorialPlatformer2D/releases/tag/Package  


I made this playable demo to showcase the instructions outlined in my tutorial serie: How to Make a 2D Platformer in Unity. I wanted to make a simple and comprehensive introduction to creating games with Unity with code, explanation and assets available to everyone.
