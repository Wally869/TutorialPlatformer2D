Code and Assets for a Simple Platformer Demo in Unity for a Tutorial  

I made this playable demo to showcase the instructions outlined in my tutorial serie: How to Make a 2D Platformer in Unity. I wanted to make a simple and comprehensive introduction to creating games with Unity with code, explanation and assets available to everyone.  

FEATURES:  
- Player Controller for movement and animation  
- Patrolling Monster  
- End Game Target    
- Level Creation with Tilemaps  
  
A lot of other introductory stuff presented in a simple and approachable manner!
